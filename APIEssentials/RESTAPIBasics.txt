This contains RESTAPI Basics

RESTAPI
A way for client and servers to communicate using:
> HTTP methods
> URLs as Resource Identifiers
> JSON as data format
> Stateless communication

RESTAPI - Representational State Transfer
It is a set of architectural principles for designing APIs

These can be built using
> FastAPI
> Flask
> Node.js (Express)
> Django
> Spring boot
> Go fiber

HTTP methods
> GET - Retrieve data, idempotent, safe, cacheable
> POST - Create new resource, Not idempotent
> PUT - replace entire resource
> PATCH - Partially update resource
> DELETE - Delete resource, idempotent

URL Structure
-------------

REST Endpoint designing:
BAD:
/createUser
/getUserDetails

Good:
/users
/users/{id}
/users/{id}/orders

Query Params vs Path Params
---------------------------

Path Param = identifies a resource
GET /users/10
Query Param = filter/sorting/search
GET /products?max_price=100&color=red

Status Codes
------------

Code  Meaning
200     OK
201     Resource Created
204     No content 
400     Bad request
401     Unauthorized
403     Forbidden
404     Not Found
409     Conflict
500     Server Error

CRUD API for a Resource (Users)
-------------------------------
Create        - POST/users
Read all      - GET/users
Read one      - GET/users/{id}
Update full   - PUT/users/{id}
Update partial- PATCH/users/{id}
Delete        - DELETE/userse/{id}


Best Practices for Production APIs
----------------------------------
Pagination - GET/users?page=2&page_size=20
Filtering  - GET/users?min_age=18&city=NY
Sorting    - GET/users?sort_by=name&order=asc
Versioning - /v1/users 
Auth       - API keys, JWT tokens, OAuth

Interview Questions
-------------------
1. Difference between PUT and PATCH
    Put is for full replace, patch is for partial update

2. Itempotent methods   
    get, put and Delete

3. statelessness in REST
    servers donot store client session
    every request must carry auth (API key)

4. How to design scalable REST APIs?
    By incorporating pagination, caching, rate limiting, load balancing, stateless servers, consistent naming, versioning

5. When to use Path Params vs Query Params?
    Path = when identifiying specific resource - like GET
    Query = while search, filter or sort

6. Difference between REST and GraphQL
    REST - multiple endpoints
    GraphQL - single endpoint, client specifies fields

7. Design a REST API for a TO do app
    Resources: todos, users (optional)
    Endpoints: 
        Create a todo
            POST/todos
            Body: {
                "title": "abc",
                "completed": false,
                
            }
            Response: 201 created

        Get all todos
            GET/todos
            Response: 200 OK

        Get a specific todo
            GET/todos/{id}
            Response: 200 OK
            404 if not Found

        change a todo
            PUT/todos/{id}

        modify a todo
            PATCH/todos/{id}

        delete a todo
            DELETE/todos/{id}
            Response: 204 No content

        filter
            GET/todos?completed=true
            GET/todos?user_id=23

8. What is pagination?
    Prevents returning huge datasets
    Query Params: GET/products?limit=20&offset=40
    Response:
    {
        "page": 2,
        "page_size": 20,
        "total": 450,
        "data": [...]
    }
